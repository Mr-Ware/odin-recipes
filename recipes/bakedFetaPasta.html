    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Baked feta pasta is a simple recipe made by oven roasting a block of feta cheese with cherry tomatoes to create a salty and cheesy sauce!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Tomatoes: Opt for cherry or grape tomatoes for this recipe. Their small size means optimal flavor, and the presentation of the tomatoes when they burst is just stunning.</li>
            <li>Feta Cheese: Use a block of feta cheese for best results. That’s because the block is less processed and will give a more melty consistency when baked.</li>
            <li>Pasta: You can use any pasta you’d like or even make this with gluten-free pasta.</li>
            <li>Seasoning & Herbs: You’ll need olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic and basil. Play around with the seasoning and herbs if you’d like. You can try using some fresh oregano, fresh thyme or switching the fresh garlic for roasted garlic.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a baking dish that’s safe for the oven like this one, add the tomatoes, olive oil, salt and pepper and mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the block of feta cheese to the center of the baking dish, and either flip it around a couple times to coat it with the olive oil and seasoning, or just add a touch more olive oil and a couple cracks of fresh black pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake it in the oven until the tomatoes burst and the feta looks melted (and your house smells heavenly!)</li>
        </ol>
